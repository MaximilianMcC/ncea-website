# What is Iterative improvement?
Iterative improvement is when someone is constantly documenting and recording their interactions with the project. An example of this is adjusting or adding new features and then getting feedback from the client and stakeholders. With this feedback improvements on the work can be made. This process allows both sides to know what work they are doing, what work has been done, and how said work has been done at all times. The main way that this is shown is through trialing and testing. In a real world work environment, after each iteration the code would be pushed to some sort of version control system, such as GitHub, for review. Iterative improvement helps to create a better end-product.

# Relevant implications
### **Legal**
Legal implications state who owns a particular piece of media and how that media can be interacted with by people who don’t own the media. One way of figuring out if media is legal is to use copyrighting. If something is copyrighted, then there are specific rules about who can use it. Permissions may need to be given, or the user could potentially be arrested or fined. In the case of this website everything is copyright free, except for the media used in testing. If media is being used for educational purposes, it is allowed to be used without direct consent from the respected owner. I have addressed these relevant implications by not using any copyright material during the development process of my website. In the future when I start adding the text and images to the website then my client may purchase the rights to certain media.


### **Aesthetics**
This website has been designed with aesthetics in mind. Aesthetics implications are the look and feel of the website. The design was created from the client looking at many different sites and picking out certain elements that they liked the look of. For example, they might like the font that was used in a site or the layout of images. With each change I made I asked the client if they were happy and what changes were needed to be made. The overall design of the website is very clean and simple. There is frequent use of dark colors and small clusters of the eye-catching orange accent colors. SVG waves are used to make the user feel more relaxed and calmer. The website has been designed so that any person of any age can confidently use the site without any issues. I have addressed these relevant implications by following my mockups closely to match the style that my client has asked for.


# Web Design Tools
This is a list of tools that I will be using to create my website. I'm not gonna include pictures and audio as these are currently just placeholders.

# Gantt charts
### **Information**
These gantt charts say when I will be working on the project. I will be creating multiple iterations of them so that I can keep up to date. When you look at the gantt chart then you will see some different colors. The table below will explain what each color is.
| **Color**  | **Thing** |
|:----------:|:---------:|
| None | Break/nothing |
| Orange | HTML |
| Pink | SCSS |
| Yellow | JS |

### **First iteration**
Here is my first gantt chart iteration. This was made before I started to make the website. I split everything up into components like the ones above and I allocated one hour of time to each "section". I knew that I would not use the entire hour for many things, but just incase there was some problems I allocated an entire hour.

### **Second iteration**
Here is the second gantt chart iteration. I created this one kind of in the middle as I had started to create the website. In this version I added in breaks that I took, and put in the correct times that I spent so far. I kept the events at one hour as I thought it would be complicated because of having JS and Google Maps integration. I also pushed the responsive part out to the next day.

### **Third iteration**
Here is the third and final iteration of my gantt chart. This one has the correct times for the events, and I have decided to keep the time for responsive design for 1 hour.

# Component Trialing
Below is a table showing the different components that I trialed when making my website. Trialing is when you look at possible solutions of a problem, then select the best one that works for your specific needs.
| **Trial**  | **Thing that I'm trialing** | **First trial** | **Second trial** | **Third/Final result** |
|:----------:|:---------------------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| 1          | Play and pause audio icons | Just having normal text can be boring and isn't really the standard. ![Trialing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Trial1%201.png) | Using these icons may look good, but it's really bad practice. For example someone could be on a device that hasn't got those characters. ![Trialing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Trial1%202.png) | fa icons fit in with my UI. They were quick and easy to integrate using a CDN ![Trialing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Trial1%203.png) | 
| 2          | Generate events  | Hand writing in all of the events as HTML is time consuming and can't be automated. ![Trialing evidence 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Trial2%201.png) | | Generating the events from JS is much better as the object can be sent over as JSON from a server ![Trialing evidence 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Trial2%202.png) |
| 4          | Make content stack when viewing on smaller screens | | | I'm using a css media breakpoint to change the code at specific screen sizes. It would have been better for me to use a mobile-first approach to the website, however I have already made the site. ![Trialing evidence 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Trial3%201.png) |

# Component Testing
Below is a table showing some of the different components that I tested when making my website. Testing is when you check for if a feature that you have implemented works as expected without any problems.
| **Test** | **Thing that I'm testing** | **First test** | **Second/Final test** |
|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:--------------:|:---------------------:|
| 1        | All content fits nicely on the screen with no overflow | | ![Testing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing1%201.png) ![Testing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing1%202.png) ![Testing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing1%203.png) ![Testing evidence 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing1%204.png)|
| 2         | Content stacks when the website is in mobile mode | | ![Testing evidence 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing2%201.png) ![Testing evidence 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing2%202.png) |
| 3         | Audio can be played and paused | The button is "reversed" ![Testing evidence 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing3%201.png) | The button works as expected ![Testing evidence 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Testing3%202.png) |

# Stakeholder feedback and improvements
After each "section" of my gantt chart had been completed I showed my client what the website was currently looking like. Together we discussed things that they liked, and some things that they didn't like. Here is a table with all the feedback, and the improvements that I made
| **Feedback**  | **My response** | **Before** | **After** |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:---------:|
| "The events currently look plain. Can you try and add something to them that will make it match the rest of the website?" | I added a border to the side of the events. I used the websites orange theme color to maintain consistency. | ![Before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Feedback1%201.png) | ![After](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Feedback1%202.png) |
| "I think that the audio part looks like I can skip through the song. Can you please try and make it just a play button or something similar?" | I removed the volume slider functionality and replaced it with a large play/pause button instead. | ![Before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Feedback2%201.png) | ![After](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Feedback2%202.png) |
| "Can you make it so that when you put your mouse over the buttons they change color or something? Sometimes I can't tell if I'm about to press it or not." | I made a hover event on all of the links and buttons, then darkened the background color. | ![Before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Feedback3%201.png) | *(My mouse is over the left button in the screenshot)* ![After](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaximilianMcC/ncea-website/main/other/Feedback3%202.png) |

# Code validation
All code validation is done by inserting the GitHub deployment link into [This website](https://validator.w3.org/)

### **Homepage code validation**
| **Results** | **Justification** |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
| **Error:** Attribute `state` not allowed on element `button` at this point. | To make the custom audio player I use this custom attribute to tell if the audio is playing or not. |

### **Events page code validation**
There was nothing wrong with the events page. All code is correct.

# Usability
To make sure the website is ready for real world use I asked some of my friends and family to use it for a few minutes. I then asked them to all give me some feedback about something that they did like, and some things that they didn't like then I ran those over with the client and asked them if they had anything that needed to be added. They said that they are currently happy with the website and until it gets more content there is no need to adding other features.

# Final Evaluation
Throughout this project I used an iterative process to help me both design and develop my client's website. I was guided by the wire-frames and mockups that I created with help from my client in the first part of this project. I picked out different tools and resources that would be able to help me create my website to the best of my abilities. To begin my project I created a new GitHub Repo to store all of my code and written work on. I chose GitHub as it allows me to work on my website where ever I am. All I need to do is clone the project, then I can commit and push my new changes. I then started to create my website and collect feedback, trialing, and testing data so that I could reach an outcome that the client is satisfied with.

I began with adding boilerplate code. I didn't bother adding this to the gantt chart as it only look a few minutes. The boilerplate had everything that I needed to start making my website. Here is a tree of the boilerplate:
```
root/
├─ assets/
│  ├─ img/
│
├─ styles/
│  ├─ style.scss
│
├─ index.html
├─ script.js
```
Later on in the process I did stuff such as add and rename files. To help be understand what I was to be doing I broke my website down into a todo list of components, then I created a gantt chart to display my progress and keep on track. The gantt chart helped me stick to my time frame and get everything completed. I made many different iterations of my gantt chart. Each iteration improved upon the last to make the most accurate chart. I gave the GitHub repo link to my client so that they could view the GitHub Pages deployment and compare it with my gantt chart to make sure I was on track.

As I began coding my website I recorded some testing and trialing data so that I could demonstrate my iterative skills. This was helpful because if I was to run into the problem again I would need to re-invent the wheel, but with the testing and trialing data I can quickly diagnose the issue and continue making the site. When I was making the website I very carefully followed my mockups.

While I was making my website I got occasional feedback from the client. One of the features that they wanted me to change was removing the volume slider on the music player. I took their feedback and removed the slider and we both agree that it makes the site look much better as it fits in more with the general style of the site. When I was gathering user feedback then I asked some of my friends. They helped me figure out what parts of the website needed editing.

When I was nearing the completion of my website I incorporated responsive design so that no matter what device and screen size your are viewing the website on it will look good. I designed the site in a kind of mobile-first way so that I only needed to add one breakpoint in my SCSS. One of my final steps was to run all of my code through a HTML validator to check for errors. In future I will installer a linter into my IDE, Visual Studio Code, to do this process automatically. I was lucky and didn't get any unexpected error when validating my code.

By using an iterative design and development process I could create a website that my client is satisfied with.
